** a waiver of any subsequent breach of such provision or a waiver of any breach of any other
** provision of this Agreement.
** This Agreement may not be superseded, modified, or amended except in a writing signed by an officer
** of each party. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal
** or otherwise unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the extent possible consistent
** with the intent of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in
** full force and effect. This Agreement will be fairly interpreted in accordance with its terms
** and without any strict construction against either party because it was drafted by such party
** or for any other reason. This Agreement will constitute the entire agreement between the parties
** relating to the subject matter hereof, and expressly supersedes and replaces all prior
